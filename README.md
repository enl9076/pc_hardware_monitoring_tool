# pc_hardware_monitoring_tool
Tool to monitor pc stats (e.g., cpu usage, disk space, etc).

*This project is currently in progress*

I started this project to be able to display the hardware stats of my first pc build. Then I decided to make different versions as well.

#### Functionality
Currently prints out the following information in the command line:
* Processor name along with its rated speed, cores, and threads
* Motherboard name
* Total available RAM
* Amount of total storage space and available storage space on each drive installed

It also polls the system every 2 seconds to print out the current CPU and RAM usage.

##### To Do
* Convert to a dashboard or GUI to visualize the information in an aesthetically pleasing way
* Make it cross-platform compatible
* Access GPU info and CPU temperature on Windows
